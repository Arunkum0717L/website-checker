# Website Safety Checker

This is a pure frontend (client-side) JavaScript web app that lets you check if a website is reachable and returns a basic safety status.

## 🔒 Features
- Simple client-side URL safety check
- Measures response time
- Detects CORS/HTTPS errors
- No backend or hosting required

## 🧱 Folder Structure
```
website-safety-checker-js/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── style.css
├── README.md
```

## 🚀 How to Run
Open `public/index.html` directly in your browser. No installation needed.

## ⚠️ Limitations
